NOTE WELL, DEAR READER: None of this is intended as a public API!  I reserve
the right to change anything and everything about how this library works at the
merest whim.

If you're actually trying to write something that uses this library, please
contact me (or whatever people/constructs are maintaining this after I quit
computers forever) to discuss how we could best design a sensible API that
would actually work for you.

Your pal,
